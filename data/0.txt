(1)
The life of Albert Einstein is a model in many ways for both natural and political scientists.
First of all, he always employed the scientific method of seeking truth from facts. He firmly believed as he put it, that “there is nothing incomprehensible about the universe,” and through painstaking work, explained many of the phenomena thought to be “incomprehensible” in his day. Einstein was also never afraid to admit mistakes when facts proved his theories wrong.
Second, Einstein’s contributions showed the great importance of theoretical work to scientific effort. Although he himself rarely worked in laboratories, the concepts he developed led to many of the scientific advances which have shaped modern technology.
Third, Einstein believed very deeply that scientists must have a moral and social consciousness. In this way, he provided inspiration for a whole generation of scientists who became active in the Communist movement.
Einstein is often portrayed in bourgeois writings as a “genius” whose theories are so complicated that no one but a few best scientists can understand them. But he himself rejected the efforts to put him in a position far above other people. He was well known for his humble manner and often stressed to interviewers that his accomplishments would certainly have been achieved by others had he never lived.
Actually, Einstein’s theory of relativity and his other scientific works are not that hard to understand with a little study. But beyond learning Einstein’s theories, his overall attitude towards science as a tool to liberate humanity is something from which everyone can and should learn.

Between now and the end of the century, there will be many exciting developments and also many difficult problems to deal with. Perhaps the most urgent problem is to provide enough food. The world’s population is expected to reach 7,000 million by the year 2000, but already scientists have produced new and better varieties of wheat and rice and animal. They have also been experimenting with techniques of cultivating plants by using mixtures of chemical compounds and water only, and then there will be no need for ordinary soil. Another problem which the world will face is to get rid of refuse (废料). One solution is to burn refuse at very high temperatures in incinerators (焚化炉). A development of this, which may prove very useful in the future, is to use these incinerators to generate steam power. In fact, any new source of energy will be very welcome, as there is already a shortage of petroleum. To solve the energy problem, scientists will probably also try to make more use of solar energy.
The possible effects of some scientific fields, such as lasers and cryogenics (低温学), are difficult to imagine and both already have a number of uses. The supercooling effects of the cryogenics which convert liquid helium (液态氦) and other gases into “superfluids” and metals into “superconductors”, making them non-resistant to electricity, could change the world in a number of ways. The laser, with its beam of strong light, can drill a hole in a diamond, and yet can be so well controlled that it can be used in delicate eye operations. The question is whether it will be most used for peaceful purposes or as a deadly weapon.
But perhaps the most remarkable developments will occur in space flight. One of the difficulties in the past has been the high cost, but now the space shuttle is being developed, and can be used a large number of times instead of only once. Already man has been to the moon. Perhaps by the end of the century he will have had a close-up view of Venus (金星) or Mars (火星).
