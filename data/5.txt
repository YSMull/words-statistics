When I was about twelve, I suddenly developed a great passion 大16家 writing poetry. I gave up all my other hobbies, such as 大17家 stamps, and spent all my 大18家 time reading poetry and writing it. This habit of writing poetry on every possible 大19家 soon got me into trouble at school. If a lesson did not interest me, I would take out my notebook and start writing poems in class. Of course I did this very 大20家, but it was not long before I got caught. One day while I was busy writing a poem during a geography lesson, I looked up to find the teacher standing over me, fuming with anger because I was not 大21家 attention. He tore the poem up, with a 大22家 not to waste time in his lesson. All the same I was convinced that I had written a good poem, so that evening I wrote it out again from memory. Not long after, I read about a poetry contest and I decided to send in my poem. Weeks later, long after I had given up hope, I got a letter informing me I had won first 大23家. Everyone at school was very impressed ― except the geography teacher, who 大24家 me more carefully than ever. He was quite 大25家 that I was not going to write poetry in his lesson!

Section VIII	English-Chinese Translation
Choose either of the following two passages. Only the underlined sentences are to be translated. (20 points)
(1)
Television is now playing a very important part in our life. But television, like other things, has both advantages and disadvantages. Do the former outweigh the latter?
In the first place, television is not only a convenient source of entertainment, but also a comparatively cheap one. (66) For a family of four, for example, it is more convenient as well as cheaper to sit comfortably at home, with almost unlimited entertainment available, than to go out in search of amusement elsewhere. (67) They do not have to pay for expensive seats at the theatre, the cinema, or the opera, only to discover, perhaps, that the show is disappointing. (68) All they have to do is press a button, and they can see plays, films, operas, and shows of every kind, not to mention political discussions and the latest exciting football match. (69) Some people, however, maintain that this is precisely where the danger lies. The television viewer takes no initiative. He makes no choice and exercises no judgment. (70) He is completely passive and has everything presented to him without any effort on his part.
(71) Television, it is often said, keeps one informed about current events, allows one to follow the latest developments in science and politics, and offers and endless series of programs which are both instructive and entertaining. The most distant countries and the strangest custom are brought right into one's sitting-room. (72) It could be argued that the radio performs this service just as well; but on television everything is much more living, much more real. Yet here again there a danger. We get so used to looking at it, so dependent on its flickering pictures, that it begins to dominate our lives.
There are many other arguments for and against television. The poor quality of its programs is often criticized. But it is undoubtedly a great comfort to many lonely elderly people. And does it corrupt or instruct our children? I think we must realize that television in itself is neither good nor bad. (73) It is the uses to which it is put that determine its value to society.
(2)
An office is the "Brain" of a business. (74) In an office, figures, lists and information are compiled which tell the managers or heads of the business what is happening in their shops or factories. These figures guide the managers by telling them what has happened and what is happening.
Information comes into an office in all sorts of ways but the main items of information come in regularly. (75) It is part of the job of the clerks to collect and classify that information and to put it into such a form that it is easily interpreted and understood. Offices collect information then they classify it.
This work of collection is common in an office from the sorting of mail every morning to the accountant's work in finding out the final figure for the year's profit. (76) Classification always requires the arrangement of the same kind of information, often into lists or columns. (77) For this work, correctness, accuracy and speed, as in all office work, are essential.
There is no value, however, in collecting figures which mean nothing. Figures are guides which should help we make decisions. (78) The interpretation of information and of tables should tell us where success or failure lies, where profit can be had and where losses occur. (79) On this kind of information and from the known figures, a choice is made and a series of such choices may make a policy.
A firm which has three factories may find, for instance, from its figures, that one factory is losing money and a choice may lie between either a change of manager, a cut in production, an increase in production or closure of the factory. Whichever one of these decisions is taken becomes the policy. (80) It is clear that a decision leading to a policy can only be as good as the information on which it is based.
Consequently there is a constant search for more and more exact information. (81) Managers will want to have all the necessary facts before they can make the best decision and it is normal for them to seek for more and more information.
